When ready to release for testing/production: 

1.1 Update the EZXApexRiskGUI\Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs file to increment the File Version and Product Version.  
1.2 Update Resources.resx - CopyrightText1 year every January.
1.3 Update View\AboutWindow.xaml.cs build date for each build.

2. Synchronize changes with repository and get all incoming changes

3. Run all unit tests.

3. Check all changes into CVS.

4. Update Bugzilla etc.

5. To build/compile: When building EZXApexRiskGUI, select the "Debug / Any CPU" build configuration.  This should set all
the projects to build with Platform Target = Any CPU (and with Debug flags). 

The EZXApexRiskGUI build is configured to output compiled assemblies and executable to:
	 EZXApexRiskGUI\bin\Debug 
	 
6. Create an installer using the Astrum Install Wizard

The installer file is in C:\dev\EZXLightspeedWPFSolution\Installer\EZXApexRiskGUISetup.ai2
(Be aware if you are working on branched code to use the correct path)
Once open, change the version number and run "Create Setup"

Update the version number in Installer settings to the new release version.

7. Do a test run. Verify local installation worked correctly and some of the new changes are visible
when using the new installed version.

8. Check in Installer (and any more changes) to CVS

9. Tag CVS with new Version, using form:  
	EZXApexRiskGUI_r_<major>_<minor>_<build>
